## Requirements

```bash
tensorflow>=2.x
pandas
matplotlib
```

## Installation

```bash
pip install tensorflow pandas matplotlib
```

## Usage

### Basic Training

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from model import Model, Custom_Loop, convert_and_shuffle

# Load your dataset (MNIST or Fashion-MNIST)
df = pd.read_csv('mnist_train_small.csv')[:30000]

# Prepare datasets
train_set, test_set, valid_set = convert_and_shuffle(df, '6')

# Initialize model and training components
model = Model()
loss = tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=False)
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.AdamW(learning_rate=0.001, weight_decay=1e-4)
metrics = tf.keras.metrics.SparseCategoricalAccuracy()

# Create custom training loop
loop = Custom_Loop(model, optimizer, loss, train_set, valid_set, metrics)

# Train the model
loop.loop(epochs=42, steps_per_epoch=300)

# Get training history
train_loss, valid_loss, train_acc, valid_acc = loop.history()
```

### Data Preprocessing

The `convert_and_shuffle` function handles:
- **Normalization**: Scales pixel values to [0, 1]
- **Train/Val/Test Split**: 60% training, 20% validation, 20% test
- **Shuffling**: Buffer size of 2500 with seed for reproducibility
- **Batching**: Default batch size of 32
- **Optimization**: Prefetching and caching for performance

### Visualization

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Plot training history
plt.figure(figsize=(15,15))

# Loss comparison
plt.subplot(2,2,1)
plt.plot(train_loss, label='Train Loss')
plt.plot(valid_loss, label='Validation Loss')
plt.legend()

# Accuracy comparison
plt.subplot(2,2,2)
plt.plot(train_acc, label='Train Accuracy')
plt.plot(valid_acc, label='Validation Accuracy')
plt.legend()

plt.show()
```

## Model Configuration

### Hyperparameters

| Parameter | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Learning Rate | 0.001 | AdamW optimizer learning rate |
| Weight Decay | 1e-4 | L2 regularization strength |
| Batch Size | 32 | Training batch size |
| Dropout Rate | 0.4 | Dropout probability |
| Gaussian Noise | 0.1 | Standard deviation for noise |
| Epochs | 42 | Training epochs |
| Steps per Epoch | 300 | Training steps per epoch |

### Regularization Techniques

1. **Gaussian Noise**: Improves model robustness and generalization
2. **Batch Normalization**: Reduces internal covariate shift
3. **Dropout (40%)**: Prevents co-adaptation of neurons
4. **Weight Decay (1e-4)**: L2 regularization via AdamW optimizer

## Custom Training Loop

The implementation features a custom training loop with:

- **@tf.function Decorator**: Compiles training step for faster execution
- **Simultaneous Training & Validation**: Evaluates on validation set each step
- **Early Stopping**: Patience-based mechanism (patience=5)
- **Gradient Computation**: Manual gradient tape for flexibility
- **Metric Tracking**: Separate metrics for training and validation

### Early Stopping Logic

```python
if validation_loss < best_loss:
    best_loss = validation_loss
    patience = 5  # Reset patience
else:
    patience -= 1  # Decrease patience
```

## Dataset Compatibility

This model works seamlessly with:

-  **MNIST**: Handwritten digits (0-9)
-  **Fashion-MNIST**: Clothing items (10 classes)
-  **CIFAR-10**: Natural images (with proper preprocessing)

Simply adjust the input data format and target column name in `convert_and_shuffle()`.

## Training Output

```

## Results Interpretation

### MNIST Performance (93-95%)
The model excels at digit recognition due to:
- Clear, simple patterns
- High contrast images
- Consistent writing styles

### Fashion-MNIST Performance (82-84%)
Slightly lower accuracy due to:
- More complex visual patterns
- Similar-looking classes (e.g., shirts vs. t-shirts)
- Greater intra-class variability
